#### Course Description   

This course provides an introduction to the python programming language and to the
libraries that are most useful for business research. By the end of the course, students will be able to program in python, will be familiar with several different IDEs, and will have enough knowledge of relevant libraries to undertake various types of business research.


#### Course Deliverables

Each student will perform a replication in python of the key parts of a paper in his or
her area of research. The replication should demonstrate command of several different
components of research; for example, data handling, econometrics, and visualization.
The replications are due by December 1.
